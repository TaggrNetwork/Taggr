## System Dependencies

- Install [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/).
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

## First Time Setup

Clone the Taggr repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:TaggrNetwork/taggr.git
```

Change your directory to the newly cloned Taggr repo:

```shell
cd taggr
```

The remaining steps are only necessary for deploying NNS canisters locally. This makes it easier to test new account creation with Internet Identity, to make ICP transfers to those accounts or to run Taggr e2e tests without a Docker container. Alternatively, you can [create a backup](#creating-and-restoring-backups) and then refer to the [command reference](#command-reference) to build and deploy.

Create or edit `~/.config/dfx/networks.json`, and add the following, note that `dfx install` requires port `8080` to work:

```json
{
  "local": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1:8080",
    "type": "ephemeral",
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "system"
    }
  }
}
```

Stop DFX if it's running:

```shell
dfx stop
```

Start DFX with a clean environment:

```shell
dfx start --clean --background
```

Install NNS canisters (see the [DFX docs](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/dfx-nns.md)):

```shell
dfx nns install
```

Now you are ready to create a new Taggr account with Internet Identity locally. If you also want to make ICP transfers to this account then continue with the remaining steps, the remaining steps are not necessary for running e2e tests.

Set up the private key for the local minting account:

```shell
cat <<EOF >~/.config/dfx/local-minter.pem
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEICJxApEbuZznKFpV+VKACRK30i6+7u5Z13/DOl18cIC+oAcGBSuBBAAK
oUQDQgAEPas6Iag4TUx+Uop+3NhE6s3FlayFtbwdhRVjvOar0kPTfE/N8N6btRnd
74ly5xXEBNSXiENyxhEuzOZrIWMCNQ==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF
```

Import the key into DFX:

```shell
dfx identity import local-minter ~/.config/dfx/local-minter.pem
```

Change to the new identity in DFX:

```shell
dfx identity use local-minter
```

Stop running DFX, Taggr is setup with the assumption that DFX runs on port `55554` so use the `make start` command from now on to start DFX:

```shell
dfx stop
```

At this point, you can refer to the [command reference](#command-reference) to deploy and run Taggr, create a new account and grab your account ID. Then you can transfer ICP to that account with this command:

```shell
dfx ledger transfer --memo 1000 --amount 10 ${accountId}
```

## e2e Tests

Make sure to follow the [first time setup instructions](#first-time-setup) before running e2e tests without using the Dockerfile.

Run the test UI, this is great for watching the tests run as they are happening and checking screenshots at each stage:

```shell
npm run test:e2e -- --ui
```

To collect a static trace for tests:

```shell
npm run test:e2e -- --trace on
```

To help determine if tests are flaky, run them multiple times, note that only the file's name is required, not its full path. If the filename is ommited then all tests will be run multiple times:

```shell
npm run test:e2e -- ${test_filename}.spec.ts --trace on --repeat-each 10
```

During development, it can be common to write an incorrect selector or something else that will cause the test to timeout. If it's happening frequently and slowing down the feedback cycle then the max timeout can be set to a lower value. Be careful not to set it too low or you may get false negatives in the tests:

```shell
npm run test:e2e -- --timeout 10000
```

To update screenshots/snapshots:

```shell
npm run test:e2e -- -u
```

## Creating and Restoring backups

1. Pull the backup from Taggr (heap only):

   - As a stalwart, in the browser console, execute:
     ```js
     api.call("heap_to_stable");
     ```
   - Locally run:
     ```shell
     ./backup.sh /path/to/backup
     ```

2. Restore the backup to the local canister:
   ```shell
   ./backup.sh /path/to/backup restore
   ```
