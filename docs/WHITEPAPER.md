# $name

$name aims to serve as a public good, providing decentralized and censorship-resistant services for content publishing and communication.
It operates on the public compute infrastructure powered by the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org).

## Key Points

-   $name combines features of forums and blogs.
-   $name is tokenized and is owned and governed by its token holders.
-   $name is completely ad-free and generates revenue.
-   $name uses its revenue to reward content producers, token holders (pro-rata) and to cover storage and compute costs.

## Usage Costs

Each interaction with other users on $name consumes credits.
All payments are directed to [$name's Treasury](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/dee15d98a70029163c79ace6ec9cf33b21917355f1766f44f87b4cb9f4d3b393) which holds the revenue.
Below is a breakdown of costs.

| Function             |       credits üî• | Comments                                       |
| :------------------- | ---------------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| New post or comment  |     `$post_cost` | Excluding hashtags                             |
| Hashtags             |  `T * $tag_cost` | For `T` unique hashtags in a post or comment   |
| On-chain pictures    | `B * $blob_cost` | For `B` pictures in a post or comment          |
| Poll                 |     `$poll_cost` | For adding a poll to a post or comment         |
| Reacting with ‚ù§Ô∏è     |              `2` | Burns `$reaction_fee` credits, adds `1` karma  |
| Reacting with üî•, üòÜ |              `6` | Burns `$reaction_fee` credits, adds `5` karma  |
| Reacting with ‚≠êÔ∏è    |             `11` | Burns `$reaction_fee` credits, adds `10` karma |
| Reacting with üëé     |              `3` | Burns `3` credits and karma of post's author   |
| New realm creation   |    `$realm_cost` | Burns `$realm_cost` credits                    |

Notes:

1. Each response to a post increases the author's karma by `$response_reward`.
2. Inactive users' karma and credits decrease by `$inactivity_penalty` per week after `$inactivity_duration_weeks` weeks of inactivity.
3. Users with negative karma don't participate in reward distributions.

## Rewards and Revenue Distribution

-   During positive interactions, users can receive karma from other users.
-   Earned karma points are converted to rewards during the next distribution.
-   Rewards are calculated by converting `$credits_per_xdr` karma points to ICP at the credit minting rate (`1 XDR` / `$credits_per_xdr`).
-   Additionally, users owning tokens and being active within the last `$revenue_share_activity_weeks` weeks receive a share of $name's revenue proportionate to their token holdings.

## Bootcamp

New users undergo a "bootcamp" period lasting `$trusted_user_min_age_weeks` weeks.
During this period, users cannot impact others' karma through engagements, downvote posts, or vote on proposals.
If after the bootcamp period a user still has less than `$trusted_user_min_karma` karma points, they remain in bootcamp until the karma threshold is reached.

## Stalwarts

Stalwarts represent the union of top `$stalwart_percentage%` of users with the highest karma and with the highest $`$token_symbol`  balance, active during the last`$min_stalwart_activity_weeks` consecutive weeks, possessing accounts older than `$min_stalwart_account_age_weeks`weeks, and maintaining at least`$min_stalwart_karma` karma points.
They are considered trusted community members, authorized to carry out moderating actions and propose upgrades.

## Realms

Realms are sub-communities centered around specific topics.
Each realm can establish its own terms and conditions, breaching which can lead to:

-   Flagging of the user's post to stalwarts.
-   Removal of the post from the realm, incurring a penalty of `$realm_cleanup_penalty` credits and karma points.

Upon joining a realm, users implicitly agree to its terms and conditions.

## Content and Behavior Policy

Decentralization does not equate to lawlessness!
Content and behavior permitted on $name aligns with community-approved moderation guidelines.
Content and behavior not permitted on $name falls into one of the following categories:

-   Content and behavior that jeopardize $name as a public service (e.g., those illegal in many jurisdictions).
-   Content or behavior detrimental to the community, sustainability, or decentralization of $name.
-   Content created with malicious intent, such as gaming the $name system.
-   Content and behavior that violate realm-specific rules.

This policy is intentionally broad and necessitates social consensus among stalwarts.

**Posts contravening this policy are subject to moderation.**

## Moderation

Moderation on $name is decentralized; anyone can initiate it, and stalwarts can execute it.
Whenever a post or user is reported, all stalwarts receive notifications and are expected to validate or dismiss the report.
Once `$report_confirmation_percentage%` of stalwarts concur on the report's validity, it is closed.
For confirmed reports:

-   The violating user loses `$reporting_penalty_post` (post report) or `$reporting_penalty_misbehaviour` (user report) karma points, along with an equivalent amount of credits.
-   The reporter receives half of this penalty as karma points.

If stalwarts dismiss the report, the reporter loses half the penalty as credits and karma points.
In both cases, participating stalwarts share karma points from the penalty fee, capped at `$stalwart_moderation_reward`.

## Governance

$name is governed via proposals.
There are proposals for upgrading the main smart contract, for minting new tokens for funding & rewards and for transfering ICP out of the treasury for off-chains activities of the DAO.

A proposal succeeds if `$proposal_approval_threshold%` of users approve it or fails if `(100 - $proposal_approval_threshold)%` of users reject it.
Only tokens of registered users active within `$voting_power_activity_weeks` weeks count as participating votes.
To prevent low-quality proposals, a proposal rejected with a rejected/adopted ratio under `$proposal_controversy_threashold%` incurs a loss of `$proposal_rejection_penalty` karma points and credits for the proposer.

The total voting power of all registered users required to adopt or reject a proposal decreases daily by `1%` while the proposal remains open.
This is achieved by multiplying the total available voting power by a factor `d%`, where `d` is the number of days the proposal remains open.
This ensures any proposal eventually passes within `100` days.

Voting on a proposal is rewarded with `$voting_reward` karma points.

For any pending proposal the following holds until it gets adopted, rejected or cancelled:

-   the $$token_symbol tokens of voters who voted on that proposal are locked and cannot be transferred;
-   the rewards and the token minting are deferred for everyone.

## Tokenomics

The utility of the `$token_symbol` token is the $name governance and a share in $name's revenue.
$name has a total supply of `$total_supply` tokens.

### Supply Increase

New tokens can only be mined by users or minted via proposals.
The minting will be suspended automatically once the maximum supply is reached.

### Supply Decrease

When a `$token_symbol` transfer transaction gets executed, the fee of `$fee` gets burned.
Once the maximal supply is reached, it can go below the maximum again after enough fees are burned via transfer transactions.
In this case, the minting will be activated again.
This will make the supply to find an equilibrium around the maximal supply.

### Distribution of minted tokens

Currently, all users who earn karma become eligible for receiving newly minted `$token_symbol` tokens.
On a weekly basis, for every user who rewarded others (the karma donor), $name will generate new tokens limited by donor's  `$token_symbol`  balance divided by the minting ratio  `R`(see below).
These new tokens will be assigned to all rewarded users weighted by the share of received karma and an additional factor `F`   which depends on receivers    `$token_symbol` balance:

| Receiver's $token_symbol balance | `F`    |
| -------------------------------- | ------ |
| Below `100`                      | `1.2`  |
| Below `250`                      | `1.15` |
| Below `500`                      | `1.1`  |
| Below `1000`                     | `1`    |

The minting ratio `R` is algorithmically computed by $name.
It starts at `1:1` and remains at this level until `10%` of supply is minted.
Then the ratio decreases to `2:1` for the next `10%`, further decreasing to `4:1`, and so on.
Hence, the last `10%` of supply will be minted at a ratio of `512:1`.

### Team Tokens

`20%` of tokens are allocated to the first two users forming an informal bootstrapping team before the tokenization:

-   `18%` to @X (founder and the only software developer),
-   `2%` to @mechaquan (growth & marketing).

Tokens are minted weekly, with each user receiving an amount equal to `1%` of the current supply if and only if one of the following conditions are met:

-   Their individual share is below `14%` of minted supply.
-   `2/3` of the total supply has been minted.

Vesting tokens:

-   @mechaquan: `$vesting_tokens_m`
-   @X: `$vesting_tokens_x`

## Autonomy

$name is designed for full autonomy, guided by decentralization.
It autonomously creates new storage canisters when space runs out.
$name tops up canisters with low credits using ICP from the Treasury.
The [dashboard](/#/dashboard) provides information on system status and past events.

## The Taggr Network Neuron

$name DAO votes on NNS proposals with neuron [$neuron_id](http://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/$neuron_id) and doesn't follow anyone.

#### Neuron Decentralization

Neuron's controller lacks a known secret key.
The main canister votes via the hot-key mechanism.
The neuron doesn't follow anyone in neuron management.
$name canister's `get_neuron_info` method confirms this:

    dfx canister --network ic call $canister_id get_neuron_info

#### Voting

Proposals categorized as "Governance", "Network Economics", "Replica Version Management," and "SNS & Community Fund" display as posts with polls.
$name canister votes on these proposals after 3 days, weighted by voters' square root of karma.

Other proposals are automatically rejected.
$name DAO commits to:

1. Attract voters to other topics over time.
2. Find followees or vote themselves if automated rejection harms #IC.

## Bots

$name users can become bots by adding principal IDs in account settings.
These IDs (canisters or self-authenticating) can call $name's `add_post` method in Candid format as follows:

    "add_post": (text, vec record { text; blob }, opt nat64, opt text) -> (variant { Ok: nat64; Err: text });

Arguments:

-   `text`: body text.
-   `vec record {text; blob}`: vector of attached pictures, each tuple containing a blob ID and the blob itself. Tuple requirements:
    -   ID length < `9` characters.
    -   Blob < `$max_blob_size_bytes` bytes.
    -   Pictures referenced from the post by URL `/blob/<id>`.
-   `opt nat64`: parent post ID.
-   `opt text`: realm name.

Note: #IC doesn't support messages > `2Mb`.
The result of `add_post` contains the new post's ID or an error message.

## Code and Bug Bounty

$name's [code](https://github.com/TaggrNetwork/taggr) is open source, under GPL license.

$name's DAO has a bug bounty program with classifications and rewards in `$token_symbol`.
